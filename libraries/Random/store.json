The strongest evidence to date shows that calories matter, but focusing on food quality is an equally important part of preventing weight gain and promoting weight loss.\nFocus on eating high-quality foods in appropriately sized portions.\nConsider quality, not just calories\n“A calorie is a calorie” is an oft-repeated dietary slogan, and not overeating is indeed an important health measure. Rather than focusing on calories alone, however, emerging research shows that quality is also key in determining what we should eat and what we should avoid in order to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Rather than choosing foods based only on caloric value, think instead about choosing high-quality, healthy foods, and minimizing low-quality foods.\nHigh-quality foods include unrefined, minimally processed foods such as vegetables and fruits, whole grains, healthy fats and healthy sources of protein – the foods recommended in the Healthy Eating Plate.\nLower-quality foods include highly processed snack foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined (white) grains, refined sugar, fried foods, foods high in saturated and trans fats, and high-glycemic foods such as potatoes.\nThere isn’t one “perfect” diet for everyone, owing to individual differences in genes and lifestyle.\nQuality counts\nOne study analyzed whether certain foods were more or less likely to promote weight gain. This type of research examining specific foods and drinks allows us to understand whether “a calorie is a calorie,” or if eating more higher-quality foods and fewer lower-quality foods can lead to weight loss and maintenance.\nResearchers in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health show us that quality is in fact very important in determining what we should eat to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and that the notion of “a calorie is a calorie” does not tell the whole story.\nIn a study of over 120,000 healthy women and men spanning 20 years, researchers determined that weight change was most strongly associated with the intake of potato chips, potatoes, sugar-sweetened beverages, and both processed and unprocessed red meats. The researchers concluded that consumption of processed foods higher in starches, refined grains, fats, and sugars can increase weight gain.\nFoods shown to be associated with weight loss were vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and yogurt.\nResearchers did not discount the importance of calories, instead suggesting that choosing high-quality foods (and decreasing consumption of lower-quality foods) is an important factor in helping individuals consume fewer calories. (23)\nView the HSPH news release, “Changes in specific dietary factors may have big impact on long-term weight gain: Weight-loss Strategy to Only ‘Eat Less, Exercise More” May be Overly Simplistic’”\nManaging macronutrients: Does it matter?\nWith the proliferation of macronutrient-based diets over the past several decades, from low-fat to low-carbohydrate, discussion of the three main macronutrients – carbohydrates, proteins, and fats – has become standard when talking about optimal diets. Researchers have begun comparing these “macronutrient management”-style diets to one another in order to determine which is most effective, but thus far evidence is largely inconclusive.\nOne study, published in JAMA in 2007, compared four weight-loss diets ranging from low to high carbohydrate intake. This 12-month trial followed over 300 overweight and obese premenopausal women, randomly assigning them to either an Atkins (very low carbohydrate), Zone (low carbohydrate), LEARN (high carbohydrate), or Ornish (very high in carbohydrate) diet.\nAfter one year, weight loss was greater for women in the Atkins diet group compared with the other diet groups.\nThis study also examined secondary outcomes focused on metabolic effects (such as cholesterol, body fat percentage, glucose levels and blood pressure), and found that those for the Atkins group were comparable with or more favorable than the other diet groups.\nThere was no significant difference in weight loss among the other three diets (Zone, LEARN, and Ornish).\nThis study does raise questions about about long-term effects and mechanisms, but the researchers concluded that a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible recommendation for weight loss. (24)\nAnother study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2009, challenged the above study’s findings by testing four different types of diets and producing results that showed comparable average weight loss among the different diets.\nThe study followed 800 people over 2 years, assigning subjects to one of four diets: Low-fat and average-protein, low-fat and high-protein, high-fat and average-protein, and high-fat and high protein.\nResearchers concluded that all of the diets resulted in meaningful weight loss, despite the differences in macronutrient composition.\nThe study also found that the more group counseling sessions participants attended, the more weight they lost, and the less weight they regained. This supports the idea that not only is what you eat important, but behavioral, psychological, and social factors are important for weight loss as well. (25)\nAn additional study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2010, looked at the role of protein and glycemic index upon weight loss maintenance. Researchers first implemented a low-calorie diet to produce weight loss, then examined whether protein and glycemic index impacted weight loss maintenance.\nThe study population was made up of nearly 800 overweight adults from European countries who had lost at least 8% of their initial body weight with a low-calorie diet. Participants were then assigned one of five diets to prevent weight regain over a 26-week period: A low-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a low-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, or a control diet.\nThe low-protein-high-glycemic-index diet was associated with subsequent significant weight regain, and weight regain was less in the groups assigned to a high-protein diet than in those assigned to a low-protein diet, as well as less in the groups assigned to a low-glycemic-index diet than in those assigned to a high-glycemic-index diet.\nThese results show that a modest increase in protein content and a modest reduction in the glycemic index led to an improvement in maintenance of weight loss. (26)\nThe results from these three studies suggest that there may be some benefits to a macronutrient-based dietary approach, but research also shows that while a particular diet may result in weight loss for one person, it may not be effective for another person due to individual differences in genes and lifestyle. For those seeking the “perfect” one-size-fits-all diet, then, there isn’t one! The great news is that everyone can follow The Healthy Eating Plate guidelines and choose healthy, flavorful foods to create a diet that works best for you.\nReferences\n23.

That's in line with Apple's promise at WWDC 2022 that the new Air would arrive in July, and with the company's pattern of splitting pre-orders and normal sales for its latest products across two consecutive Fridays. (opens in new tab)MacBook Air M2 (8GB/256GB, 8-core GPU): $1,199 @ Apple (opens in new tab)\nWhile the new MacBook Air M2's not on sale yet, you can go to the Apple Store page and select your color and specs ready for when it's available. The base model comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, plus a slightly watered-down Apple M2 chip with an 8-core GPU instead of the full 10 cores. You can spec the regular M2 chip, more RAM and storage and a more powerful charger if you wish, as well as pick from Midnight, Starlight, Silver and Space Gray colorways View Deal (opens in new tab)The MacBook Air M2 is quite a bit more expensive than the previous MacBook Air M1. But the addition of the Apple M2 chip, a new lighter design with a larger notched display, better speakers and a higher resolution webcam are all worthwhile-sounding upgrades that seem to justify the expense. The MacBook Air M1 is sticking around at its $1,000 price for now, if you are not fussed about getting the latest hardware.Apple's other new laptop, the MacBook Pro M2, already launched this month. However, this machine has had some bad press recently since its base model can't outperform the old MacBook Pro M1 on certain benchmarks due to its slower SSD transfer speeds. We'll be interested in seeing if the MacBook Air M2 suffers from the same performance problems in its default spec as the MacBook Pro M2. If it does, we may recommend buying extra storage or RAM for your Air, as the higher-specced MacBook Pro models seem to not have this issue.The MacBook Air M2 may not be Apple's newest lightweight laptop for long though, says the rumor mill. We're hearing things about a MacBook Air 15-inch model that could arrive in the spring of next year. This would apparently take the Air series beyond 13 inches for the first time, and may also offer the rumored Apple M2 Pro chip alongside the regular M2 silicon.For now, take a look at our MacBook Air M2 hands-on for our initial thoughts on this redesigned MacBook, and our guide on how to pre-order the MacBook Air M2 if you want some pointers on where you could get the best offers.\nRichard Priday\n(opens in new tab)\nStaff Writer\nRichard is a Tom's Guide staff writer based in London, covering news, reviews and how-tos for phones, gaming, audio and whatever else people need advice on.

As the Energy Information Administration explains, gasoline prices are mainly affected by the price of crude oil, a fossil fuel that is refined into gasoline. And the price of crude oil is set on the global market, based largely on worldwide supply and demand.\nWhen economic activity declined sharply in the U.S. and other countries early in the COVID-19 pandemic, global demand for crude oil declined along with it, leading to a dramatic drop in the price of crude oil and gasoline, and, consequently, a drop in new spending and investments by oil companies. Then, as the global economy began to recover, and people began to resume their regular activities, including travel, global demand for crude oil increased rapidly while the global supply was not able to keep pace.\nA gas pump at a gas station in McLean, Virginia, on June 10. Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images.\nExperts previously told us that imbalance increased the price of crude oil and gasoline, prices that climbed even higher after Russia, one of the world’s largest oil exporters, invaded Ukraine in late February. In response to the attack, the U.S. and other nations put sanctions and bans on Russian oil\n— creating more volatility in the global market.\nDespite those factors, campaign ads from Republican politicians and groups have falsely claimed or suggested that President Joe Biden and Democrats are solely to blame for the prices that motorists are paying at the pump.\n“When Joe Biden was elected, gas cost $2.43,” says the narrator of a National Republican Senatorial Committee ad attacking Democrat John Fetterman in Pennsylvania. “Biden started choking oil production his very first day. Now, five bucks a gallon.”\nIn an ad released last month, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who is running for reelection, said “gas prices doubled” when “Democrats took control” and “limited oil production” and “shut down the Keystone pipeline.”\nAn ad from Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington, who is also seeking another term in Congress, claimed, “Gas prices are skyrocketing because of D.C. bureaucrats’ war on American energy production.” The ad says Herrera Beutler supports more oil and natural gas production “here at home.”\nBut energy analysts also have said that neither U.S. crude oil production nor the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline is what is driving prices up.\nWhy Have Gasoline Prices Increased?\nIt’s true, as some of the ads say, that the U.S. average weekly price for a gallon of regular gasoline has more than doubled since Biden has been president. It went from $2.38 the week ending two days before Biden was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021, to a record of more than $5 the week of June 13, according to the most recent EIA data.\nThe daily figures from AAA show the average national price per gallon of regular gas was down to $4.84, as of July 1.\nBut gas prices began rising before Biden’s inauguration. When he took office, the average weekly price had already increased about 60 cents from a low of $1.77 a gallon in April 2020, under then-President Donald Trump.\nAnd according to those who analyze energy markets, the primary reason prices increased toward the end of 2020 and then in 2021, is because the demand for oil around the world began to exceed the available international supply.\n“U.S. gasoline prices follow gyrations in world oil markets, which depend on global (not domestic) supply and demand,” Alan Reynolds, an economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, wrote in a May 10 post.\n“What happened to world oil markets in 2020 was a global pandemic, with falling oil and gas prices followed by a sizable loss of oil and gas production capacity in the U.S. and elsewhere,” he said. “What happened in 2021 was mostly the phasing‐​out of governmental lockdown schemes which allowed production, commerce, and transportation to bounce back faster than oil and gas production could.”\nThis resulted in gasoline prices increasing in the U.S. and abroad.\n“Rising crude oil prices and increased gasoline demand contributed to the average U.S. retail price for regular grade gasoline increasing to $3.01 per gallon (gal) in 2021, the highest average nominal price since 2014,” the EIA said in a January 2022 post.\nAs of May, the EIA said that more than half of the cost of gasoline in the U.S. was based on the price of crude oil. The remainder was determined by a combination of federal and state taxes, distribution and marketing, and refining costs and profits.\nFurther complicating matters, Russia launched a military attack on Ukraine on Feb. 24. That ongoing conflict has contributed to even higher prices this year.\n“What happened to crude oil and gasoline prices in 2022 was the Russian invasion of Ukraine, though partisans falsely deny the link between war and oil markets and instead blame President Biden for U.S. gasoline prices,” Reynolds, who served on President-elect Ronald Reagan’s transition team in 1981, wrote in May.\nIn its Short-Term Energy Outlook released in early June, the EIA said: “Russia’s actions in Ukraine, sanctions imposed on Russia because of those actions, and the resulting departure of many private American and European companies from Russia have contributed to disruptions in global crude oil supply and availability.”\nThose disruptions have increased crude oil prices, which have affected what U.S. residents are paying.\n“Current U.S. gasoline prices reflect high crude oil prices brought on by geopolitical risks related to Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine, and associated sanctions and private sector boycotts of Russia,” the EIA’s analysis said.\nWrong Reasons for the Price Increases\nRegardless of those facts, many Republicans and conservative groups have attempted to place most, if not all, of the blame for the current price crunch on the president and congressional Democrats.\nIn addition to the ads from the NRSC, Thune and Herrera Beutler, an ad the American Action Network is running in Maine says Biden and Democratic Rep. Jared Golden “turned off more American energy production” and “put the brakes on pipelines and future drilling here at home.” The ad’s narrator says, “Now, gas prices and heating oil cost more than ever.”\nAnother AAN ad airing in Kansas says “gas prices are the highest ever on record” after “Biden, Davids and the liberals in Washington attacked American energy production, halted pipelines, hamstrung explorations.” The ad urges viewers to “tell Congresswoman Sharice Davids to help open American energy production and lower the price of gas.”\nBut experts have told us that domestic crude oil production, and the often-cited Keystone XL pipeline cancellation, are not the reasons for high gas prices.\nKeystone XL, which was originally proposed in 2008, would have transported oil from Canada through the U.S. to Gulf Coast refineries. It was officially canceled in June 2021, months after Biden revoked a permit that developers needed to complete the project.\nHowever, the pipeline “wouldn’t have been online by now under any circumstances,” Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis and a co-founder of the Oil Price Information Service, told us in late February. TC Energy, Keystone XL’s owner, had projected that the pipeline, which would have been an extension of the existing Keystone pipeline system, would not have been placed into service until 2023 at the earliest.\nThen, in March, for a story about how both Democrats and Republicans have spun the facts about domestic oil production, Kloza told us that the price of oil “doesn’t really have much to do with US crude production.”\nU.S. crude oil production has gone down in recent years — dropping about 8% before Biden took office, from 2019 to 2020, and another 1.1% in 2021, according to the EIA. But that’s because of the pandemic.\nAbhi Rajendran, head of global oil/downstream markets, North America Energy Research at Energy Intelligence, told us earlier this year that after the price collapse in early 2020, companies greatly reduced their capital expenditures, and there has been only “a very modest recovery” since. It will take time for supply to increase, he said, because the pandemic also affected labor, oilfield service supply and equipment supply.\n“Covid had a major impact on where we are today by cutting global and US oil production, production that came online again far slower than we’ve seen demand recover,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, which tracks fuel prices, explained to us in an email. “In addition, due to a large decline in demand, some refiners shut down their plants after failing to sell them. They were hemorrhaging money during the pandemic.”\nDe Haan has said that the decline in U.S. refining capacity due to COVID-19 is another factor contributing to high gas prices now.\nIn Biden’s first 14 months in office (ending in March), the U.S. produced an average of 11.24 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to the latest EIA data. That’s about 1.3% less than the nearly 11.39 million barrels produced per day in the last 14 months under Trump.\nLast month, the EIA projected that U.S. crude oil production would average close to 12 million barrels per day in 2022. If that happens, it would be the second highest annual average on record – and within 3% of the average production of nearly 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019. The EIA expects the U.S. to produce an average of almost 13 million barrels per day in 2023, which would be a new record.\nBiden did sign an executive order in his first week in office putting a pause on new oil and natural gas leasing on federal lands and water, an executive action that was blocked by a Louisiana federal judge in June 2021. That same month, the Interior Department also suspended the Trump-approved Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\nBut Samantha Gross, director of the Energy Security and Climate Initiative and a fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, told us in March that “Biden’s slowing of federal leasing is a SMALL issue for producers, and has made no difference at all in what is being produced today.” That’s because it would take years for companies to start producing oil from any new leases, she said.\nRajendran also told us at the time that the Biden administration “has very little … direct responsibility for where we are from a supply standpoint.”\nBiden actually has been urging U.S. oil companies and other major energy-producing nations to increase production, drawing criticism from environmentalists who want to see the country less dependent on energy from fossil fuels — a stance that was a focal point of Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign platform.\nAnd since last fall, Biden has authorized the release of more than 200 million gallons of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which some experts predicted could reduce crude oil prices by a few cents.\nBiden’s ‘Small’ Impact on Prices?\nBut Biden’s hands are not completely clean in the current situation, according to De Haan.\n“There’s no denying Biden has some blame for rising #gasprices, but it is far far from 100%,” he tweeted on June 26, in response to another Twitter user’s purported “analysis of why the gas prices situation is ALL Biden’s fault.”\nDe Haan told FactCheck.org that Biden has sent unclear signals about fossil fuels to oil companies that may be looking for reasons to invest. That confusion has played a minor role in gasoline prices, he said in an email.\n“Of today’s high prices, he shares a small part of the blame,” De Haan said of Biden.\n“Biden could offer clarity on the future of fossil fuels which, if done right, may give oil companies more direction if investments they make into raising production or adding refinery capacity will be worthwhile,” he said. “That’s where I think he’s done a poor job.”\nInstead, De Haan said Biden has thrown oil companies under the bus for high prices, requested an investigation into possible price gouging, and made conflicting comments about wanting to shut down fossil fuels. “That’s not a conducive climate for oil producers and refiners to invest, and that’s where he can be blamed,” the petroleum analyst said.\nKloza did not exactly agree.\nIn an email to us, he acknowledged that “there is an adversarial relationship between” Biden’s administration and oil and gas companies, and that the administration “has stumbled with its messaging.” But, Kloza said, most of the surge in gasoline prices can be attributed to just three factors: the “huge global bounce back from COVID” and the closure or reconfiguration of some oil refineries in the U.S. and Canada; the Russian invasion of Ukraine; and the 2020 formation of OPEC Plus, an alliance between the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and a separate group of 10 non-OPEC members, including Russia.\nIn January, the EIA said that slower global oil production in 2021 was mainly due to cuts that OPEC Plus nations started making at the end of 2020. The alliance only agreed to begin making some gradual increases in production late in 2021.\n“My view: President Biden and his administration are being falsely accused of pursuing policies that led to rampant price inflation,” Kloza said.\nIn a March survey, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas asked more than 100 oil and gas executives to name the primary reason they believe publicly traded oil producers are “restraining growth despite high oil prices.” Of the executives who responded, 11% cited “environmental, social and governance issues,” and 6% said “governmental regulations.” The main reason, cited by 59% of respondents, was “investor pressure to maintain capital discipline,” which prioritizes profits for investors.\nEarlier this year, Rajendran told us that the relationship between companies and investors is a key factor to watch, and that the supply crunch has been “exacerbated” by investors “shifting their preference, away from growth” to “much more restrained spending.”\n“This was actually a dynamic that was already kind of taking off, you know, pre-COVID. It really kind of kicked into gear over the last couple of years,” he said.\nStill, the main factors contributing to high gasoline prices are residual oil supply and demand issues, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which continues to cause more uncertainty in the oil market. Prices in the U.S. have not skyrocketed or doubled because of Biden and Democratic policies, as Republican ads lead viewers to believe.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Then I swapped WealthSimple’s allocation to US stocks to European stocks. It’s not perfect and will be remedied in the future when I get return data for UK gilts – I already have for UK stocks.

And by logging, I mean really good logging.\nLogging is one of the things I was never tasked with nor ever really mastered.\nI imagine it must be nice to have a logging system in place that helps, not only to record bugs, but to help engineers recreate bugs during testing.\nThe problem is, I have no clear idea on how to get there.\nCan anyone shine a light on this area of development?45 commentssharesavehidereport96% UpvotedLog in or sign up to leave a commentLog InSign UpSort by: best\nlevel 1 · 3 mo. ago2full-stackLogs can be a useful debugging tool, if used correctly. Here's some things I've learned about logging. Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on logging, I've mostly learned by doing.Log levels: Very common logs should be lower level. You should inspect the logging output occasionally and re-assign the level of items that are too noisy.Structured logging: Any decent logging library supports structured logging. If you're inserting a variable into the log message string, consider if it would be better as a field.You should be able to find the source code for any given log entry. Use unique messages, prefixes, etc. When debugging, you may want to trace a code path using log messages, but that's more difficult if multiple places create the same log entry.Since logging is normally used after something goes wrong, you need to create logs that will be useful later. It's not always possible to get this right first try. After changing code, you can have a review step where you think about what new information should be logged (factoring in past issues).Log viewer: Reading a text file of log messages isn't very helpful. Good log viewers help filter information (hide or highlight fields), show trends (eg log frequency over time), and preform structured searches.99ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 2 · 3 mo. agoThanks for the good advice4ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 2 · 3 mo. agoStructured loggingEven better if you log JSON instead of plaintext (even if its still structured).Imagine:{\"app\": \"myapp\", \"event\": \"api-call-x\", \"function\": \"myfunc\", \"timestamp\": \"2022-03-21T20:46:01\" }\nYou can add your app's version, container name, and a ton more.Then get that information into the ELK stack (Elastic, Logstash and Kibana combo) so you can easily search for specific keys or turn that data into nice graphs.Practical example: With the help of jq, I turned the output of df -T to track the volume usage of several databases into a nice JSON message that I now turned into a graph, so I can see which volume is nearing 100% usage so I can request a larger volume, instead of having to wait for a DB to crash and burn.It's a temporary solution, but the official one is taking its sweet time, so I slapped this together in about 2 hours.PS: Figuring out the ELK stack if a bit of a pain to find what's what, but it's also an immensely powerful tool that I don't use often enough.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 2 · 3 mo. agoFor log levels, the best setup is to be able to control it at both a global and an individual level.I could set my entire server's log level to \"TRACE\", but I like to set it up so that I can send a cookie with a HTTP request which will set the log level for that request to \"TRACE\" even though the global level is \"WARN\".1ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 1 · 3 mo. agoOne important thing with logging is context. You should be able to search for a uuid primary key from your database and find all the relevant logging information later when you need.\nLike searching a user_id, order_id or whatever else should find you relevant logs,\nHaving a log that has nothing but a string message saying \"the code got here\" isn't particularly helpful.16ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 2 · 3 mo. agoAlso use a correlation id to connect log entries to the same request.12ReplyShareReportSaveFollowContinue this thread level 1 · 3 mo. agoPersonally I think it is worth it to use a service for this (Sentry, Splunk, DataDog, etc.) You want a robust, relatively painless to implement and easily searchable/filterable solution. You want error logging, maybe performance logging, maybe user journey logging, maybe analytics. You also want log rotation and storage. It's much easier to just go with a paid service than to roll your own for all of this (especially if you are trying to build an app or service... why also build a logging solution).32ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 2 · 3 mo. agoIf you're going to roll your own, there is the open source Graylog Open.I prefer DataDog or SumoLogic if you're a funded dev shop with a reasonable budget, although I see Graylog is now offering Cloud and Enterprise managed versions of their open source app.13ReplyShareReportSaveFollowContinue this thread level 1 · 3 mo. agoStructured logging: Choose either JSON or logfmt. The message field should usually contain a fixed string such as \"Started payment\", while separate fields should be used to denote structured and dynamic information (e.g. payment_id). This way, you never have to re-parse a log line.Maybe reinvent the wheel: Sometimes all it takes is a simple class Log and #define LOG(msg) Log(msg, __FILE__, __LINE__) (contrived example for C++) to make your logging consistent (same structured field names, format, log levels), and no framework is needed. Depends on your use case. A framework makes sense for languages where 3rd-party packages are integrated and their logging can be fine-tuned by the framework (e.g. Rust's logging macros).Log important events: At the very least, log errors (you'd be surprised how often I saw in legacy business code that this was not done). Don't offload that responsibility only to the caller of your service, but do it inside your service. Also log the start of relevant functions, including informational fields (e.g. payment_id, trace_id if you use logs-to-traces correlation features). That very much depends on business logic, so your outages and problem cases will tell you more specifically what you want to have logged. Try to go through a customer complaint in your head and think of what would need to be logged for you to find out afterwards what happened, and when.Tooling: Observability tools like Grafana Loki or Datadog allow parsing structured logs easily, visualize in human format and can even show graphs (slower to query than time series metrics, but you do not require metrics for everything). Links to logs, dashboards, traces and other helpful tools during an incident should be stored as bookmarks in your browser. Also, it should be easy to view logs while developing – JSON logs are probably not great to read, but I don't have a good recommendation here (logfmt is somewhat more readable at least).11ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 1 · 3 mo. agotheres some really good input already here, so i’ll just add this https://12factor.net/logs8ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 1 · 3 mo. agolaravelThe trick is often getting logging for the right environments you have. For instance at one place I worked we had all API calls to external services in our logs, overkill but worth it.Good logging is a skill you mainly build over time and experience. Whenever you build a feature, ask yourself, if someone does something stupid with this, how would I know about it?\nAnd work from there.3ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 1 · 3 mo. agoNEVER log PII (Personal identifiable information). You'll get in trouble if your log entries contain email addresses, phone numbers, names, addresses etc. In some countries even an IP address is identifiable information.The same naturally applies to api keys, authentication tokens and other secrets that may compromise a service or a user account.The easiest way to make this mistake is to log a request object when an API call happens (or fails). These objects often contain all of the above or even more (e.g. sensitive information, business secrets, private conversations, depending on the type of service in question)Having a user id logged is usually fine as it's not identifiable on its own. Someone has to do a lookup to the database to find out who that is but it should be irrelevant unless there is a need to identify a malicious user account or something similar.12ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 2 · 3 mo. agoSo if someone fills out a form and it succeeds, the data goes to my back end with all user information and is saved that is ok, but if the same form produces an error i send the data to my logging server and save it its not ok?3ReplyShareReportSaveFollowContinue this thread level 2 · 3 mo. agoDisagree with this one. I think it really “depends”,\nsome logging will require all application data to be stored. e.g. database logs used for recovery. Other logs it may be incredibly useful to log application data which you can then use to marry up with database logs.So long as you have clear access restrictions in place, retention rules set, and protocols about what gets written to what log, you can really put whatever you want in there.0ReplyShareReportSaveFollowContinue this thread level 2 · 3 mo. agoDisagree with this one.

This means you'll be able to see all the log entries for that request. This helps you identify an issue when you're able to find a specific request. Often a request will successfully complete but an action wasn't taken that should have been taken.Log input and output for requests. You want to see what input you got and what output you got. Often people will complain something didn't happen but you look at the request they made and it didn't have data that was needed for the action they wanted. Or they'll said they received Y but you can see they got X.Use something like kibana or loggly. You want to be able to have saved searches and the ability to do something stuff such as create dashboards for specific events.Diagnostic logging is not something you should avoid.can't use context and if you do the variable should be at the end of the message. This will make your log message easy to find.Diagnostic logging is not something you should avoid. Diagnostic logging is when you add logs to find out what is going on. So if you do an if statement you could add a log there. If you're doing API calls you would log the input and output of logs.Add unique log entries for every controller action/entry point. So every time there is a request there is a unique message for that request. It's best if you have it in the first few lines of the controller action. This will allow you to be told that X is broken and then look for all the logs for X since you can find those requests and then filter a search for all logs for a specific request. For example search for \"A user logs in\" between 16:00 and 16:02 and you have 10 then you can find a process id or whatever id you have for request identification and then search for logs for that process id.Provide the process/request id in the error message and tell people to report that id your error page. This will help you find the exact logs easily.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 1 · 3 mo. agoI do QA and have had a few jobs I've needed to monitor live logs to pinpoint hard to solve errors. I found it very similar to combat in a MUD. You don't read much of it after a point. You start to do visual pattern recognition on what the lines of text look like to spot the bad lines.So I guess from a QA perspective,\nkeep things consistent and well formatted to make errors easier to spot.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollowlevel 1 · 3 mo. agoActivity Logging is incredibly useful if you ever have to do log analysis (or optimizing UX)2ReplyShareReportSaveFollowAbout Communityr/webdevA community dedicated to all things web development: both front-end and back-end.

filter json data by date range in javascript\nAsk Question\nAsked\n6 years, 10 months ago\nModified\n7 months ago\nViewed\n84k times\n21\n10\nI want to filter the below json data by start date and end date, it should return the data between start date and end date, I tried to achieve using below code but I'm doing wrong something to filter. I'm new to front end technologies like Javascript and jquery, it would be appreciated if Someone can correct me what I'm doing wrong here:\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Test</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar product_data = [\n{\n\"productId\": \"12\",\n\"productName\": \"ProductA\",\n\"productPrice\": \"1562\",\n\"ProductDateCreated\": \"2015-07-24T12:58:17.430Z\",\n\"TotalProduct\": 294\n},\n{\n\"productId\": \"13\",\n\"productName\": \"ProductB\",\n\"productPrice\": \"8545\",\n\"TotalProduct\": 294,\n\"ProductHits\": {\n\"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z\"\n}\n},\n{\n\"productId\": \"14\",\n\"productName\": \"ProductC\",\n\"productPrice\": \"8654\",\n\"TotalProduct\": 78,\n\"ProductHits\": {\n\"2015-08-10T00:00:00Z\"\n}\n},\n{\n\"productId\": \"15\",\n\"productName\": \"ProductD\",\n\"productPrice\": \"87456\",\n\"TotalProduct\": 878,\n\"ProductHits\": {\n\"2015-05-12T00:00:00Z\"\n}\n}\n];\nvar startDate = \"2015-08-04\";\nvar endDate = \"2015-08-12\";\nvar resultProductData = product_data.filter(\nfunction (a)\n{\nreturn (a.ProductHits) > startDate && (a.ProductHits) < endDate;\n});\nconsole.log(resultProductData);\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\njavascript jquery json\nShare\nImprove this question\nFollow\nedited Aug 13, 2015 at 7:12\njquery beginner\nasked Aug 13, 2015 at 0:42\njquery beginnerjquery beginner\n29111 gold badge33 silver badges99 bronze badges\n7\nyou compare strings. you have to compare dates.

I hope it is also clearly documented ;)\n– Joshua K\nAug 13, 2015 at 2:02\n1\n@jquerybeginner that depends on your timezone. see the -0700 at the end of the date? 17:00:00 o'clock + 7 hours are midnight. If you want to vonvert the date to GMT +0 you can use Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset() and Date.prototype.valueOf(). but think about it: dows it matter? all dates are changed the same way and you compare them with greater and lower operators. so... it shouldn't matter ;)\n– Joshua K\nAug 13, 2015 at 10:44\n|\nShow 1 more comment\n11\nI could not get the above solutions to work.

In Node.js and Express, middleware is a function that has access to the request and response lifecycle methods, and the next() method to continue logic in your Express server.\nIn this article you will explore how to implement morgan in your Express project.\nPrerequisites\nTo follow along with this article, you will need:\nA general understanding of Node.js is suggested, but not required. To learn more about Node.js, check out our How To Code in Node.js series.\nNode.js installed locally, which you can do by following How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment.\nStep 1 – Setting Up the Project\nAs Express.js is a Node.js framework, ensure you have the latest version of Node.js from Node.js before moving forward.\nTo include morgan in your Express project, you will need to install it as a dependency.\nCreate a new directory named express-morgan for your project:\nmkdir express-morgan\nChange into the new directory:\ncd express-morgan\nInitialize a new Node project with defaults. This will include your package.json file to access your dependencies:\nnpm init -y\nInstall morgan as a dependency:\nnpm install morgan --save\nCreate your entry file, index.js. This is where you will handle logic in your Express server:\ntouch index.js\nNow that you’ve added morgan to your project, let’s include it in your Express server. In your index.js file, instantiate an Express instance and require morgan:\nindex.js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst morgan = require('morgan');\nconst app = express();\napp.listen(3000, () => {\nconsole.debug('App listening on :3000');\n});\nWith your Express server now set up, let’s look at using morgan to add request logging.\nStep 2 – Using morgan in Express\nTo use morgan in your Express server, you can invoke an instance and pass as an argument in the .use() middleware before your HTTP requests. morgan comes with a suite of presets, or predefined format strings, to create a new logger middleware with built-in format and options. The preset tiny provides the minimal output when logging HTTP requests.\nIn your index.js file, invoke the app.use() Express middleware and pass morgan() as an argument:\nindex.js\nconst app = express();\napp.use(morgan('tiny'));\nIncluding the preset tiny as an argument to morgan() will use its built-in method, identify the URL, declare a status, and the request’s response time in milliseconds.\nAlternatively, morgan reads presets like tiny in a format string defined below:\nmorgan(':method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms');\nThis tends to the same functionality contained in the tiny preset in a format that morgan parses. Following the : symbol are morgan functions called tokens. You can use the format string to define tokens create your own custom morgan middleware.\nStep 3 – Creating Your Own Tokens\nTokens in morgan are functions identified following the : symbol. morgan allows you to create your own tokens with the .token() method.\nThe .token() method accepts a type, or the name of the token as the first argument, following a callback function. morgan will run the callback function each time a log occurs using the token. As a middleware, morgan applies the req and res objects as arguments.\nIn your index.js file, employ the .token() method, and pass a type as the first argument following an anonymous function:\nindex.js\nmorgan.token('host', function(req, res) {\nreturn req.hostname;\n});\nThe anonymous callback function will return the hostname on the req object as a new token to use in an HTTP request in your Express server.\nStep 4 – Designing Tokens with Custom Arguments\nTo denote custom arguments, you can use square brackets to define arguments passed to a token. This will allow your tokens to accept additional arguments. In your index.js file apply a custom argument to the morgan format string in the :param token:\nindex.js\napp.use(morgan(':method :host :status :param[id] :res[content-length] - :response-time ms'));\nmorgan.token('param', function(req, res, param) {\nreturn req.params[param];\n});\nThe custom argument id on the :param token in the morgan invocation will include the ID in the parameter following the .token() method.\nConclusion\nmorgan allows flexibility when logging HTTP requests and updates precise status and response time in custom format strings or in presets.

The demand for an engaging experience encompassing more onscreen information mixed with cover art continually pushes operators to adopt higher resolution UIs that match the video resolution.\nWith each step change in UI resolution, the availability of cost effective hardware is a key factor influencing rendering technology selection. Maintaining or extending the life of existing and deployed products, can result in the need to switch rendering technologies to more efficient alternatives.\nFor standard definition, HTML firmly established itself as the flexible alternative to natively coded UIs, but many operators quickly switched to Ekioh’s SVG Engine using SVG to deploy high definition services. Its speed and compact size has helped bring responsive HD resolution UIs to hardware previously only capable of a reasonable experience in SD.\nSince Ekioh’s foundation in 2006, STB performance has increased more than fivefold, making it practical to use HTML TV Browser solutions for HD UIs. Coupled with the demand for multi-platform availability and the desire to support additional third party services, HTML has once again become established as the rendering technology of choice.\nWith the shift to 4K, Flow brings the step change in performance necessary to deliver stunning ultra high resolution UIs in HTML.\nEkioh’s SVG Engine, TV Browser and Flow provide the browser solution flexibility needed to deliver sustained success in a rapidly changing market. Many of the world’s fastest growing TV networks use Ekioh technology.\nOn Demand Catalogues\nRapidly flipping through cover art and pausing to find out more about titles that catch the eye, is the key to turning an enjoyable browsing experience into a VoD transaction. A responsive and engaging catalogue that is quick to navigate increases the likelihood that viewers will spot a title they have an interest in.\nThe speed of Ekioh’s browser solutions help deliver an excellent, graphically rich user experience where viewers can move seamlessly between linear, pre-recorded and on-demand services.\nOTT Services\nOTT services are delivered over the open internet directly to the viewer’s connected device. Whilst the majority of OTT revenue is comprised of video services from companies like YouTube, there is also a vast library of information and entertainment apps.\nPartnering with a wide range of OTT application houses including Accedo, Foxuum, Sixty and YouTube, Ekioh’s TV Browser solutions provide the performance and memory management that enables the majority of OTT Apps to be used on very low cost hardware.\nFor operators who want to supplement their own service offerings with third party OTT apps, the combination of Ekioh’s SVG Engine and TV Browser in a Twin Engine configuration can be used to provide a the seamless transition back and forth between operator and OTT services.\nHbbTV & Catch-up\nHybrid broadcast broadband TV (HbbTV) is now firmly established as the channel provider’s preferred technology for supplementing their video streams with additional information and applications. Increasingly HbbTV is also being used as a basis for providing additional IP delivered programming and catch-up services.\nWith the vast array of consumer electronic devices now looking to support HbbTV features, it’s clear that a ‘one size fits all’ approach lacks the flexibility necessary for each platform provider to get the very best out of their hardware investment. To provide flexibility across the integration spectrum, Ekioh adopts a partnership model with HbbTV client stack providers providing a range of solutions from turnkey through to bespoke.\nTo complete the service delivery picture, Ekioh’s partnerships with TV Application providers including Accedo, Foxxum & Sixty provide a wealth of off-the-shelf applications which can quickly be localised as necessary and brought to market.\nHotel Systems\nWith the rapid increase in tablet computers and mobile phones, it’s increasingly important for hotel operators to resist being relegated to providers of a “simple bed and WiFi” offer. A good in-room entertainment system can be as important in maintaining a positive customer relationship as friendly staff and a welcoming lobby. In-room entertainment is a direct reflection of the hotel’s brand value and so it’s important to get it right.\nHotel systems represent a significant investment for any operator. The flexibility and performance of Ekioh technology enables hotel system providers to deliver visually compelling, personalised solutions using cost effective hardware. Ekioh’s products are used to combine information services, TV and on-demand programming to deliver an engaging customer experience which helps drive service uptake.\nIn-room integration with the hotel’s Property Management System, enables self service and, when coupled with localised advertising, helps promotes hotel services such as in-room dining. It’s not surprising therefore to know that Ekioh’s technology is increasingly being sought out by innovative hotel systems providers.\nDigital Signage\nDigital signage provides the opportunity to replace static advertising and information with eye-catching dynamic displays. By incorporating moving images, video, TV, scrolling text and compelling marketing messages, digital signage delivers a significantly greater impact than traditional displays. The ability to be able to rapidly change signage contents also allows a single display space to be used to convey many messages, considerably increasing the value of that space.\nIn order to deliver compelling, visually enticing displays in a cost effective manner, system reliability and equipment costs are key factors. The performance and low memory requirements of Ekioh’s Flow Browser are an ideal fit for the digital signage market enabling set top box and digital television technology to be used to deliver ultra high resolution, dynamic and fully animated displays.\nEnterprise Computing\nNext time you sign for a parcel, or use the self scan facilities at your local supermarket, there’s a good chance you’ll be using Ekioh technology. As point of sale and workforce management tools extend into all corners of our daily lives, manufacturers have recognised the need for fast reliable rendering technology across a wide range of resource constrained devices.\nEkioh’s Embedded Browser products provide a rich feature set within an extremely compact footprint combined with excellent memory management and high performance rendering. Desktop development and remote debugging tools are included to complement manufacturer led development ecosystems. Ekioh’s Embedded Browser products are available for a range of operating systems including Android, Linux, WindowsCE and Windows Mobile.\nDeployed in over 30 countries across 4 continents\nAny questions?\nPlease get in contact if you need any help finding the right browser for your project; we’ll be happy to discuss your needs and offer our advice.\nCONTACT US\nThe Courtyard,\n17B Sturton Street,\nCambridge,\nUK.

Check out my course on Udemy with a section showing how to do this!Click here to check out my 10 hour Nodejs Web Scraping course on Udemy!Check out my 10 hour Nodejs Web Scraping course on Udemy!We are going to see an example of how to scrape data from a simple HTML table. When you’re scraping data on the internet, tables is something you’ll come across quite often. I highly recommend you at understand the basic structure of an HTML table first, before you start scraping them.We are going to work from this simple example table I have here:https://www.codingwithstefan.com/table-example/Understand HTML Table StructureIn the table above we can see table headers, saying Company, Contact and Country.Then in the following rows we have the data of the table itself.Now let’s take a look at the HTML code of the table.We have the HTML <table> element, then we have table row (<tr>) elements inside it. In the first table row element, we have 3 <th> elements, known as table headers. Company, Contact, Country. These are the green/white row we see at the top of the table, the table header, or <th> element’s.Now on to the remaining <tr> or table rows, we can see some <td> elements, or table data elements. These contain the table’s data itself.So for each table row we have a <tr> element with a corresponding closing element, </tr>.Structure of our scraped dataThere’s different ways we could arrange our scraped data from the table. I think the simplest and most readable one, would simply be an array of objects. Each object would have a property with a name that matches the table header, and a value inside from the table data row. So it would look like this in JavaScript:So here we have an array shown by the square brackets ( [ ] ), containing the objects, each object inside the curly brackets ({ }). Once we’ve scraped the table data from the HTML and converted it into a data structure like this, we can easily manipulate it, save it in a database, do statistics and so on.In the next section, let’s move on to creating a selector that we can use to select the data we need.A look at selectors and jQuery injectionTo select and get exactly the data we need for our project from the HTML table, we have to use selectors. Let’s open up Chrome Tools with the table page. Press F12 to open Chrome Tools.Now inside Chrome Tools, click the button to select an element to inspect it.Use the Inspect Tool to select an element and see it’s HTML codeRight click on “Alfred Futterkiste”, and click on “Copy selector”.Right click the element, and select “Copy selector”.Then head on over to the Console tab, and paste your selector in using Ctrl+V or Cmd+V. Mine looks like this, yours should too:The selector generated by Chrome Tools for usLet’s go over what this selector does. The arrows here is a child selector, meaning it will select the children of a certain element. So first we will select the table child element of the HTML body element. Then we will select the <tbody> child, then the <tr> child, then the td child.Let’s try and see what this selector actually get’s us.If we type this in our Console tab$(“body > table > tbody > tr:nth-child(2) > td:nth-child(1)”).text();Missing jQuery on a website can give this type of errorWe can see it actually prints out that $(…).text is not a function. This is because the dollar sign is a shorthand for the jQuery library, and the site we are scraping doesn’t contain jQuery.We use jQuery to more easily select elements on the page we are scraping, although we could just use pure JavaScript. Another benefit is that our Cheerio package, that we use inside Nodejs has a very similar syntax to jQuery.So let’s inject jQuery into the page! I have a little Chrome Extension here that let’s me easily inject jQuery into a page, if it doesn’t have it.jQuery InjectInjects jQuery in the page.chrome.google.comThis way I can easily press the extension in Chrome, and we suddenly have jQuery injected.Now let’s try and run the .text() call again and see our output inside the console tab:Displaying the text content of the first cell in the first column of our table!Hooray! We can see the data of one of our table cells!Notice how this is only one of the table cells. This is because of the nth-child selector. The tr:nth-child(2), means that it will only select the second row in the table. This is the first table data row, since the first row is the table header.The td:nth-child(1) means we’ll only select the first table data cell in this row. Hence, we get Alfred Futterkiste!Now in the next section, let’s see how we could change our selector to select all the data of our table.Getting all the names in Chrome ToolsNow let’s change our selector a bit, so we don’t only get Alfred Futterkiste. It’s pretty cool, but we need all the data!So now we remove the :nth-child selectors, so we get all the table rows, and all the data cells!So far so good, but notice how there’s no space between the names. It’s hard to see which name is what. We need to have a list of names, not all the names in one long string. How can we do this?We could use a .each loop, to go through all the rows, and print out the name, line by line. Let’s see how that would look, try typing this out inside the console tab in Chrome Tools:$(“body > table > tbody > tr > td”).each((index, element) => {console.log($(element).text());});Remember you can use Shift+Enter to make a line break inside Chrome Tools, to make it more readable to yourself as you’re typing it in.So what’s going on here?We have a .each after the selector. The loop gives us an index and the current element that’s going through the loop.Then inside the loop, we do a console.log of this element’s text contents. We use the dollar sign ($) jQuery selector to get the text content of each DOM element. It can be a little complicated if it’s the first time you see this, but I hope you can understand it on closer inspection.With this .each() loop, we are now getting all the table cell data!Printing out every cell in our table!In the next section, let’s take a look at how we could do this process inside Nodejs as well.Getting all data inside NodejsSo now we’ve created a selector for getting all the table data, and we’ve tested that it works well in Chrome Tools. Now it’s time to use it inside Nodejs. This way we can scrape pages from a server running Nodejs, instead of only our Chrome browser.Create a new directory for your nodejs scraper.mkdir scrapingtablesNow open the directory in Visual Studio Code, and let’s start importing some packages.Inside the terminal writenpm init --yes to initialize npm, so we can import the packages.Then let’s add the necessary packages.yarn add cheerio request request-promise If you don’t have yarn, you can also use npm, but I like using yarn since it’s faster.npm i nstall request request-promiseThen make a new file called index.js inside the project folder.Now let’s start by importing the request-promise and cheerio package in the top of our index.js file:const request = require(“request-promise”);const cheerio = require(“cheerio”);Next, we’re going to make an async function that contains our code. The async keyword is so we can use the newest async/await features in JavaScript.We store the requested html page in the result variable. This html page is then passed onto cheerio.load, which returns a jQuery like object, which we call $ (dollar sign). This means we can write our code pretty much like when we were fiddling around in Chrome tools with jQuery.We can simply paste the selector and loop we found to be working in Chrome tools with jQuery, into our Nodejs code.Let’s try to run the code in nodejs and see what happens in our console. Type node index.js inside your Visual Studio Code terminal and see the result!Horray! All the table cells text content, now in Nodejs too!How cool is that! We got all the data inside Nodejs just like we did inside Chrome Tools!Let’s recap on what’s going on in the node js code here:Using the request-promise package we make an HTTP request to get the actual HTML page. We then feed this HTML page into cheerio. Cheerio returns an object that can be used just like the jQuery library on an actual webpage. We assign this to a dollar sign variable ($). This way, we can take the loop and the selector we created and tested in Chrome Tools, and use it inside Nodejs.Now we can scrape the page without having a browser open, we could even build an API that returns the scraped data. We could also build an automatic periodic scraper that scrapes the table once every hour or day, or any other interval.Okay, now let’s move on to the next section, because we still don’t have the scraped data into any data structure!Getting only company namesNow we got all the data out from the table, but how can we tell in the loop, which one is Company Name, which one is a Contact name?If you look at our output in nodejs and the table, we are simply getting the table cells content from start to finish:The names are printed from top left, to lowest right according to the HTML tableNames in corresponding HTML tableSo how can we know in the code when we are at a company name, a contact name or a country name?Well, we could do some funky switch statements based on the index use the modulus operator… but I think this solution is cleaner!Let’s just take each table row (tr element) instead, and then inside the loop, we’ll extract all table data cells. But since we loop over table rows now, we know that the first data cell is the company name, the second is contact, and the third is country.Let’s try something like this:$(“body > table > tbody > tr”).each((index, element) => {console.log($(element).find(“td”));});Now we removed the > td child selector, because we want to loop through the tr elements instead.Then we use .find(“td”) to find all child elements of td inside this element. This is basically the same as the arrow > CSS child selector we use in our “body > table > tbody > tr” selector. This is going to return an array of three td elements for every table row. But now we can easily see that element number 0 (the first element), is the company name. The second td element is the contact name, and so on.Let’s try a console.log on the first td element in each table row:$(“body > table > tbody > tr”).each((index, element) => {console.log($(element).find(“td”)[0]);});Every first data cell on index 0 of every rowOkay, now we are getting only the company names from each table row. Notice how the first result is undefined, because this is actually the table header row, which only contains <th> elements, not <td> elements.Let’s try to do this inside Nodejs now:You might notice you get some pretty strange output in the nodejs terminal:DOM elements printed out in Nodejs consoleWe’re basically getting the jQuery elements as output, and not the HTML we saw in Chrome Tools. To get the actual text content of these DOM elements, we need to do this:$(“body > table > tbody > tr”).each((index, element) => {console.log($($(element).find(“td”)[0]).text());});with .text() the text content of DOM elements is printed out insteadNow this actually gives us all the text content company names, not just the DOM elements.The code is getting a little weird now with the double dollar signs, what’s going on here?Well, .find(“td”) actually returns an array of DOM elements. To be able to get the text content of these DOM elements, we have to use the jQuery library again, hence the double $ signs.But we can make this a little more readable like this:$(“body > table > tbody > tr”).each((index, element) => {const tds = $(element).find(“td”);const company = $(tds[0]).text();console.log(company);});That’s a little better.Now notice our first console.log result was just empty, since the first row is the table headers. We can just skip the first loop with return true as an easy workaround:$(“body > table > tbody > tr”).each((index, element) => {if (index === 0) return true;const tds = $(element).find(“td”);const company = $(tds[0]).text();console.log(company);});Now getting the rest of the table headers and creating the data structure is pretty easy from here, let’s look at that in the next section!Getting the rest of the columnsNow all we need to do is to take the rest of the table data fields in each table row and assign them to variables and our objects. Then initialize an empty array and push our objects with each table row data, and we’re done!const request = require(“request-promise”);const cheerio = require(“cheerio”);async function main() {\nconst result = await request.get(“http://codingwithstefan.com/table-example\");\nconst $ = cheerio.load(result);\nconst scrapedData = [];\n$(“body > table > tbody > tr”).each((index, element) => {\nif (index === 0) return true;\nconst tds = $(element).find(“td”);\nconst company = $(tds[0]).text();\nconst contact = $(tds[1]).text();\nconst country = $(tds[2]).text();\nconst tableRow = { company, contact, country };\nscrapedData.push(tableRow);\n});\nconsole.log(scrapedData);}main();How cool is that! Now we got our HTML data in a format that we can use for anything inside Nodejs!BONUS — Scraping Tables DynamicallyIf we wanted our code to be more dynamic and use the table’s header names automatically for the object property names, we could write something like this:In this case if we are on the first table row, which is the table headers, we push all the table headers names into an array. Then we use each tableHeader as a variable name for the properties inside the object.You might argue that the other code with hard coded column names is more verbose and easier to read, but if you have a lot of different, but similar structured tables, making something dynamic like this can save you a lot of typing (and debugging in the end). Or if the table have a lot of columns.I would probably still recommend to use the “simpler” and hardcoded version if you are only scraping a table or two with a normal amount of columns.Thank you for reading the article, I hope you enjoyed it!Again, if you’d like to see a video version of this article or like to see more Nodejs Web Scraping instructions, check out my 10 hourNodejs Web Scraping Course on Udemy!-Stefan--4----4More from Stefan HyltoftFollowLove podcasts or audiobooks?

The agency will use clinical trials of variant-specific boosters developed earlier in the pandemic, manufacturing data, and animal studies to evaluate the shots.\nThe omicron variant of the virus has developed into multiple lineages. Right now, the BA.4 and BA.5 variants are the most widespread in the United States. The FDA said Thursday that the next set of booster shots should be against those versions of the virus. But pharmaceutical companies have been testing shots targeting BA.1, an earlier omicron lineage. Early data from Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech shows that those shots generate a strong immune response against the omicron virus — including the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages, although to a lesser extent than BA.1.\nPfizer has also tested a BA.4- and BA.5-specific booster in mice, and they presented that data during an FDA committee meeting this week.\nRelying on existing data will let the FDA and COVID-19 vaccine makers move more quickly to make booster shots available. But the virus is still spreading rapidly, and they may not be ready in time to stave off a BA.4 / 5 wave.\nThe FDA said it hopes to have new COVID-19 boosters available this fall. “This fall we have to go all out on our booster campaign,” said Peter Marks, head of the agency’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\nIn This Stream\nCOVID-19: variants, vaccines, news and updates\nCOVID-19 variant boosters won’t need new clinical trials for clearance, FDA says\nCOVID-19 booster shots should target omicron variants, FDA says\nView all 713 stories\nNext Up In\nScience\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nVerge Deals\nSubscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.\nJust one more thing!\nPlease confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.\nEmail (required)\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Although it costs slightly more than its direct predecessor, it’s the most cost-conscious brand new iPhone model that Apple sells.\nIn this hands-on iPhone SE 3 top features video, we take a look at what’s new, compare it to the previous-generation iPhone SE 2, and discuss some not-so-good features as well. We also consider why it may be better to consider purchasing an iPhone 11 instead, which can be had for just $70 more. Be sure to subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more iPhone SE 3 videos.\nTable of contents\nSmall size and physical Home button\nA15 Bionic\n5G cellular connectivity\nIncreased battery life\nSmart HDR 4 and Deep Fusion\nPhotographic Styles\n$429 price\nThe not-so-good features\nSame boring design and colors\nNo Night Mode\nSame 7MP front-facing Camera\nNo MagSafe\nSmall size and physical Home button\nThe design of the iPhone SE 3 could be seen as a negative, but some people no-doubt prefer the design of this phone due to two things: the smaller form factor and the physical Home button with Touch ID. I don’t have to explain why a smaller iPhone is desirable – my favorite smartphone of all time is the iPhone 13 mini – but the idea of a physical home button may appeal to those who have trouble mastering the gesture-based system that iOS has become. Besides that, I think the pandemic reminded many of us about the value of having Touch ID available for biometric authentication.\nVideo: iPhone SE 3 Top Features\nSubscribe to 9to5mac on YouTube for more videos\nA15 Bionic\nFollowing the same pattern set by the previous model, the iPhone SE 3 features the same processor as the current-generation flagship iPhone 13 lineup. Like the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, the iPhone SE 3 arrives with a powerful A15 Bionic system on a chip, which features a six-core CPU with two performance cores and four high-efficiency cores.\nThe A15 Bionic presents noticeable upgrade over the iPhone SE2, which featured the same A13 Bionic chip as the now two-generations-old iPhone 11. The A15 Bionic was known more for its efficiency upon release last September, as it doesn’t blow the previous A14 away performance-wise, but it helps usher in better battery life.\nBut it’s not just about battery life or raw speed. The A15 provides other benefits, such as support for Smart HDR 4, Photographic Styles, and Deep Fusion. The image signal processor in the A15 also improves video quality, elevating the look of skin tones and yielding reduced noise in low-light scenarios.\nIf you’re a second-generation iPhone SE owner who’s considering upgrading, you’re definitely not going to notice massive performance improvements, but the A15 is noticeably faster, paves the way for improved battery life, and unlocks new photo-centric features.\n5G cellular connectivity\n5G cellular connectivity is a welcomed new addition to the iPhone SE 3, which lacks the overhyped millimeter-wave connectivity but supports far more useful low- and mid-band 5G spectrum. For as much as Verizon and others hyped mmWave, I’ve never been able to obtain a connection since the launch of the iPhone 12 in my local area, as it requires users to be within spitting distance of a mmWave cell tower.\n5G vs LTE\nBut low-band 5G is quite useful, especially in rural areas, and faster mid-band 5G spectrum – the so-called sweet spot of the 5G layer cake – provides faster speed and the ability to travel over longer distances and penetrate walls. In other words, don’t feel like you’re missing out on so-called “true” mmWave 5G found on the iPhone 13, because in most cases it wouldn’t be available to you anyway.\nIncreased battery life\nEven with the same dimensions and design, the iPhone SE 3 has improved battery life over its direct predecessor. Working alongside a slightly larger battery with updated chemistry, the A15’s efficiency improvements yield two more hours of video playback and 10 additional hours of audio playback.\nIf you’re coming from an older iPhone, such as the iPhone 6s, you’ll be even more impressed. Apple notes that the third-generation iPhone SE offers four more hours of video playback than the iPhone 6s.\nSmart HDR 4 and Deep Fusion\nThe iPhone SE 3 features the same wide-angle camera as the iPhone SE 2, but it nonetheless receives two key photography-related upgrades with Deep Fusion and Smart HDR4.\nSmart HDR 4, the forth-generation of Apple’s intelligent HDR, applies individual adjustments to both subjects and the background for contrast, color, and noise. It does so by combining the best parts of separate exposures into a single photo.\nDeep Fusion, which debuted with the iPhone 11, is enabled by the 16-core Neural Engine on the A15 Bionic. An image processing system that utilizes advanced machine learning, Deep Fusion, unbeknown to the user, captures nine photos and fuses them together, picking the best of each. It then performs pixel-by-pixel photo processing on textures, noise, and details. In most cases Deep Fusion should result in reduced noise and increased detail, especially on high-texture areas such as sweaters, animal fur, etc.\nPhotographic Styles\nDebuting with the release of the iPhone 13, Photographic Styles allow you to apply specific styles during capture while preserving skin tones, and it lets you preview the look prior to capture. Users gain access to four different customizable styles: rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Tone and warmth settings can be customized for each style, and each setting remains persistent.\n$429 price\nAlthough the iPhone SE 3 sees a $30 price increase compared to the iPhone SE 2 that was released back in 2020, I still think it’s a reasonable price for a smartphone with Apple’s latest system on a chip and 5G cellular capability. Granted, you can get an iPhone 11 for $70 more, which provides a dual-camera system with ultra-wide camera. If you’re big into photography, the iPhone 11, at $499, is a compelling option, as it has a significantly better rear and front-facing camera system with support for 4K video capture and a 6.1-inch display with Face ID.\nBeyond that, the next cheapest iPhone that Apple sells is the iPhone 12 mini at $600. In my opinion, if you’re shopping for an iPhone SE at $429, the jump in price to the 12 mini, a smartphone with a history of battery life issues, isn’t really in the cards.\nThe not-so-good features\nSame boring design and colors\nI included design on my list of top features for the iPhone SE 3 because some people really enjoy the smaller form factor and physical Home button. But for those of you who are primarily attracted to the iPhone SE 3 due to its price, the old long-in-the-tooth iPhone 8-era design can be seen as a negative. The screen, at 4.7-inches, is smaller than the iPhone mini, and it genuinely feels cramped to use, while the large bezels make the device feel ten years old.\nOn top of that, the colors of the iPhone SE are pretty boring, too. The colors might have different names – starlight and midnight – and slightly different hues, but I wish Apple would experiment with less pedestrian colorways.\nNo Night Mode\nOf all of the camera features left out of the iPhone SE 3, Night Mode is the most practical. By using longer exposures, Night Mode allows you to take photos in low light with less noise. I don’t consider Night Mode to be a “pro” feature, or even an advanced feature. Anyone who shoots photos with their smartphones would benefit from better low light photos, so it’s unfortunate that it wasn’t included in the iPhone SE 3.\nSame 7MP front-facing Camera\nThe iPhone SE features the same 7MP front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture as the 2nd-generation iPhone SE. While that was a great improvement over the abysmal 1.2 megapixel front shooter found in the original iPhone SE, selfie cameras have improved a lot over the last several years.\nNo MagSafe\nThe iPhone SE 3 was rumored to support Apple’s MagSafe technology, which is one of the best innovations in smartphones in years. MagSafe, which debuted with the iPhone 12, is a magnetic quick-attach technology that’s used by Apple and third-party accessory makers. There are MagSafe-enabled chargers, which charge faster than standard Qi chargers, MagSafe battery packs, MagSafe-enabled wallets, and, of course, MagSafe cases.\nIt’s truly disappointing that the iPhone SE 3 doesn’t support MagSafe. Admittedly, this would have resulted in a major overhaul to the design of the iPhone SE, which in turn would have driven up costs, but it’s one of those features that I hate to be without. As you can see from the photos below, the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Wallet would have fit the dimensions of the iPhone SE 3, but in its current iteration, the phone doesn’t possess the internal components to make it work.\n9to5Mac’s take\nThe iPhone SE follows the tradition of its predecessors pretty well. It gives us the latest and greatest system on a chip inside an older budget chassis. Performance is on par with current-generation iPhones, but the iPhone SE 3, despite its adoption of 5G, lacks many of the creature comforts of modern smartphones.\nThe iPhone SE 3 will make brand new iPhone users and people coming from older iPhones happy. But in 2022, this body style and small 4.7-inch display are feeling downright ancient. And if photography and videography are important measuring sticks for you, then the iPhone 11 is a much better device in that regard.\nThe iPhone 11 features a much larger 6.1-inch edge-to-edge screen, a better real dual-camera system with ultra wide camera, Night Mode support, a higher resolution TrueDepth front-facing camera, and Face ID authentication support for just $70 more. In that regard, one could definitely make the argument that the iPhone 11 is hands-down the better purchase, despite the slower A13 system on a chip that’s approaching three years old, and despite the fact that there’s no support for Photographic Styles or Smart HDR 4.\niPhone 11 vs iPhone SE 3\nWith the way Apple supports older hardware – the original iPhone SE is running iOS 15 for crying out loud – I wouldn’t worry too much about having an A13 Bionic that’s several years old.\nWhat do you guys think?

ET\nFacebook\nShare\nTwitter\nTweet\n...\nMore\nShare\n✕\nTwitter\nTwitter\nFacebook\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nLinkedIn\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nEmail\nSeven in 10 Americans say they do not want President Biden to run for a second term, according to a new poll that comes as Biden’s approval numbers remain low and his party braces for losses this November.\nA Harvard CAPS–Harris Poll survey shared exclusively with The Hill found that 71 percent of respondents polled do not think Biden should run for a second term, compared to 29 percent who say he should run.\nAmong the contingent of respondents who believe the president should not run, 45 percent said Biden should not make another bid because he is a bad president, while about one-third of respondents said he is too old and about one-quarter said because it is time for a change.\nView Post\n“President Biden may want to run again but the voters say ‘no’ to the idea of a second term, panning the job he is doing as president. Only 30 percent of Democrats would even vote for him in a Democratic presidential primary,” Mark Penn, the co-director of the Harvard CAPS–Harris Poll survey, said.\nBut a majority of respondents — 61 percent — also say former President Trump should not run for the White House in 2024. Thirty-nine percent of respondents said the former president should run again.\nAmong the respondents polled who believe Trump should not make another bid in the next presidential cycle, 36 percent said Trump was erratic, 33 percent said he would divide the country and 30 percent said he was responsible for Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of pro-Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the election results.\nA majority of those polled said they would consider a moderate independent candidate should Biden and Trump square off against each other in 2024, including majorities of both Republicans and Democrats polled.\nSixty percent said they would consider a moderate independent candidate for president if Biden and Trump ended up running against each other in the next presidential cycle, compared to 40 percent who said they would not consider it.\nBroken down by party, 53 percent of Republicans polled and 64 percent of Democrats said they would consider a moderate independent candidate in that situation.\nThe development comes as Biden continues to suffer low approval ratings. The Harvard CAPS–Harris Poll survey found that the president has an overall approval rating of 38 percent, with respondents giving him low marks on handling inflation (28 percent), the economy (32 percent), stimulating jobs (43 percent) and reacting to COVID-19 (50 percent), among other issues.\nDemocrats are already bracing for losses this November given Biden’s low approval numbers and the historical precedent that a first-term president’s party generally suffers losses in the midterm elections.\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling last week overturning Roe v. Wade, Democrats have used abortion as an issue to galvanize voters, though it is unclear how the issue will compare to inflation and other concerns in November.\nThe polling also demonstrates that while Trump is considered one of the most influential people within his party, Americans may not necessarily be married to the idea of voting for him in 2024.\nOversight committee to hold hearing on impact of Roe reversal\nPentagon unveils $820 million security assistance package for Ukraine\nSome of that comes against the backdrop of the House Jan. 6 select committee hearings, which have sought to show how the former president and his allies tried to get state officials and others like former Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 election results.\nThe Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll survey was conducted on June 28 and 29 with 1,308 registered voters surveyed.

According to Healthy Food America, sugary drinks like sodas and juices are the country’s number one source of added sugars, packing thousands of empty calories that provide little energy and alter your body in unhealthy ways.\nA new study shows that drinking even one sugary drink a day can impact the health of your liver, increasing the odds of cancer.\nThe study was conducted by researchers from a variety of institutions and was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Nutrition, held on June 14 – 16. The research had access to data from over 90,000 women between the ages of 50 and 79, and followed up for 19 years, painting a thorough picture of their health.\nPhoto by Ashley Kirk via Unsplash\nRELATED: Binge Drinking Linked With Higher Odds Of Developing This Disease\nThe study wanted to spot patterns between sugary drinks and liver cancer. It found that women who consumed at least one of these drinks a day had 73% higher odds of developing liver cancer when compared to women who had three or fewer sugary drinks a month.\nResearchers believe sugary drinks are a risk because of sugar’s effects, which affect insulin levels and drive weight gain. All of these factors affect liver health.\nLonggang Zhao, the lead author of the study, said that the results were helpful since they showed that cutting back on these drinks is an effective preventative measure. “Replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with water, and non-sugar-sweetened coffee or tea could significantly lower liver cancer risk,” said Zhao in a press release.\nRELATED: Social Isolation Is Associated With This Condition\nIt’s important to note that the study had limitations, like the fact that it was conducted solely on older women and that it was observational. While a link between sugary drinks and liver cancer was found, the research doesn’t prove that one causes the other. It just suggests that it increases the risk.\nRead more on The Fresh Toast\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInRedditMorePinterestPocketTelegramWhatsApp\nFeatured Local Savings\nLatest Articles\nNFL Hall of Famer and Entertainer, Michael Strahan Continues To Expand His Multi-Hyphenate Status\nJuly 1, 2022\nPansy Division Celebrate 30 Years of Joy\nJuly 1, 2022\nFrom Ice T to Ultravox — the New LA Weekly Playlist is Live\nJuly 1, 2022\nLooking For An Affordable Holiday Recipe?
